	<h1>Adopt me!</h1>

	<p> Hi there, I'm pig-pro/Gacha_storm1216. And today, we're going to be talking about....BROOKHAVEN RP! Brookhaven is a game from the platform roblox. It includes some violence like guns, but there aren't killing. There also might be bankrobbing but that doesn't really do anything. You can also steal money from people's vault at home. those are all the bad thing about it. But good things includes dressing up, picking houses, and doing all kinds of stuff. Also just to warn you guys, there are secret spots in brookhaven i have found some before but i'm not gonna spoil it for you guys. At last, some things in brookhaven costs robux, robux are roblox money that cost real money to get. i don't recommend getting it, but it's cheap. That's all see y'all next time! also make sure to check my other web, about adopt me. and comment if you want to hear more games in roblox.
